                <h3>Benton Falls</h3>
                <p>Tucked within the Cherokee National Forest, Benton Falls in Tennessee is a stunning autumn destination that feels like a hidden treasure. The three-mile round-trip hike to the waterfall winds through quiet woodlands that come alive with fall color—deep reds, glowing oranges, and bright yellows blanketing the trail. The crisp air carries the scent of leaves and pine, and as you approach the falls, the soothing sound of rushing water grows stronger. Cascading nearly 65 feet over layered rock, Benton Falls becomes even more enchanting when framed by the fiery hues of the season. The reflective pool at its base mirrors the colors of the forest, creating a picture-perfect scene that captures the peaceful magic of Tennessee’s fall landscape.</p>

                <h3>Sunset Rock</h3>
                <p>Perched atop Lookout Mountain, Sunset Rock in Chattanooga, Tennessee, offers one of the most breathtaking views in the Southeast—especially in the fall. As October and November roll in, the surrounding forests transform into a vibrant tapestry of gold, crimson, and amber, stretching across the Tennessee River Valley below. The short, scenic hike to the overlook is lined with colorful hardwoods and crisp mountain air, rewarding visitors with panoramic views that glow beneath the setting sun. As daylight fades, the sandstone cliffs are bathed in warm orange light, making it easy to see how the spot earned its name. Whether you’re a hiker, photographer, or simply a lover of nature, Sunset Rock in autumn captures the essence of Tennessee’s natural beauty. </p>
