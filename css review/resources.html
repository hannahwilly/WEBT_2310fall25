                <h3>Enjoy the season of giving.</h3>
                <p>The oppportunities to serve in your community are endless. there are so many ways to serve and share the beauty og the season through lending a hand to others and participating in sommunity service events. I hope the ideas above are helpful to ideas to get you started in making a difference in your community. Make it a family event and use your free Saturday to introduce your kids to a new opportunity to serve. Serving together is a great way to model to your children a lifestyle that is others focused and teaches them the value of giving back.  </p>
